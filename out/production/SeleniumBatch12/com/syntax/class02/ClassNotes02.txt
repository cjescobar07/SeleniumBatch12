Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a WebElement
e.g. buttons, text boxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
Hyper Text Markup Language

What is DOM?
Document Object Model is the browsers internal view of the webpage.
Also called as Developers tool or Dev Tools
Document --> can store any document such as pdf, excel
Object --> any line in HTML is considered as Object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
It is an address that identifies a web element or group of
WebElements uniquely within the DOM/web page.
an address or position of a WebElement on the web page
used to locate or identify WebElements on the web page

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- Tag Name
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CSS Selector
- Classname

HTML Scripting Meaning:
Purple --> tags || button, input, div
Brown --> attributes || name, class, id
Blue --> attribute value

Why do we need many locators?
--> developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements.
--> some locators may not have duplicate values in different nodes
--> some locators may not be applicable for the element we are looking for
e.g. linkText and partialLinkText are only used for links

--> "a" tag is also called an anchor tag

--> If 2 or more elements have the same attributes and attribute values, Selenium will only interact
with the first element it locates
