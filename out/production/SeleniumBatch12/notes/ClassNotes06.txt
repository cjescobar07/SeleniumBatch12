Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop message. An Alert takes complete focus of our main page we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1. Web based alerts / html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript alerts / browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect any of the Javascript
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium or cancel

Types of Javascript alerts:
1. Simple Alert - click ok
2. Confirmation Alert - either cancel or click ok
3. Prompt Alert - enter the text and then click ok

To handle Javascript alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and passed in the URL
https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth;
     // username:password@

Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with frames:
1. By Index
2. Name or ID
3. WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
