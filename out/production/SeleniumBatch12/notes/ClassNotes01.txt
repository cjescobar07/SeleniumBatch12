Selenium Class1

What is software testing?
Identifying the correctness and quality of an application

How many ways can we test?
manual
automation

when do we go for automation?
after manual testing is passed
when environment is stable
analyze our test suite and choose our automation toll

What automation toll do we know about?
Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Katalon Studio, UFT/QTP

Level of testing?
Unit testing ->perform by devs
Integration
Acceptance Testing -> perform by clients
System testing

Types of testing?
Functional
Non-Functional testing
    Performance Testing: behavior/response time/ system stability
    Security Testing: hackable/ finds vulnerability of the software

What is Selenium?
automation testing tool, a set of tool that helps us automate web applications mainly
used to perform functional testing

Selenium Components:
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Selenium Grid--> Firefox plugin
Selenium Webdriver
Selenium RC ->Remote control

What is Selenium Webdriver?
Open source automation tool which allows us to perform actions on web applications
Webdriver is an Interface

Advantages of Selenium WebDriver:
Open source
Works with different browsers and supports cross browser testing'
Works with different programming languages --> Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python
Operating system independent --> Windows, iOS, Linux

Disadvantages of Selenium WebDriver:

No technical support
No built-in reports
Cannot test captchas, images, or videos

get() vs navigate()
navigate can go back, forward, and refresh the page
get() will wait for the page to fully load, whereas, navigate() will not
get() will not keep the history of the browser, whereas, navigate() will

close() vs quit()
close() will close the current tab
quit() will close the whole browser

fullscreen() vs maximize()
maximize() will maximize the browser and will still be able to see the control panel(back, forward, bookmarks, etc)
fullscreen() will maximize the whole application
