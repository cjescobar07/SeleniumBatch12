Selenium Class 7

Handling multiple windows(tabs)
In order for us to handle multiple windows, we will be using:
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Synchronization:
the process of bringing the speed of two or more components the same level
in this case we are brining out script and page load to the same speed level

Thread.sleep -- static wait / unconditional wait

Types of Selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait

Implicit wait:
    1) tells the webdriver to wait for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
    2) it will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
    3) We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait

--> Implicit wait works with findElement() method
--> Implicit wait is usually set to 20secs
--> If your element is found between the given time, the remaining will be ignored
    and your script will move on to the next line or action
--> If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then will you get an exception
